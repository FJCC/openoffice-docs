1. Each version of the documentation will have its own branch named for the version of the software it is written for as well as one for Miscelanious Documents.
    
   - Each branch will have two folders named  Review and Published
     - Review will be used for the editing process before a document is accepted
	 - Published will be used to contain the Published versions for that branch

2. A Template Branch will exist as well for maintinence of the various AOO templates used to produce the documents.
